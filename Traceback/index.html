    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      We all know the frustration of losing something important — the frantic searching,
      endless phone calls, and uncertainty. That stress is exactly why Traceback was created.
    </p>
    <p>
      We saw a broken system dominated by disorganized paper logs and fragmented communication.
      Our mission is to fix it by providing one central, intelligent platform where every
      lost and found item can be managed efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traceback is powered by smart technology that automatically compares the details and photos 
      from lost reports against found reports, providing real-time matches to cut down the retrieval time
    </p>
    <p>
      More than just a list, we provide a secure communication system to directly connect the 
      finder with the rightful owner and administration, ensuring items are returned safely and quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are committed to making the process of reuniting people with their belongings simple, secure, 
      and stress-free.
    </p>
    <p>
       Traceback isn't just about managing lost items; it's about giving back peace of mind.
